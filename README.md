# ESP32 BLE Gyro Mouse
This project turns an ESP32 and an MPU6050 into a wireless Bluetooth mouse. Gyroscope motion controls the cursor, and two push buttons perform left/right clicks.

# Features
- BLE HID Mouse via `BleMouse.h`
- Gyro-based cursor movement (MPU6050)
- Clicks via GPIO buttons
- Dead-zone + sensitivity scaling
- Works with Windows, Linux, macOS

# How It Works
The MPU6050 provides gyroscope readings over I2C. These are scaled and mapped to mouse movement. BLE HID is handled using the `BleMouse` library.
